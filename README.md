# BMTC Connect - Metropolitan City Transportation Database System

Utilizing Oracle RDBMS, designed and developed a database system for city transportation system from the ground up. 

The entire project was divided into four phases:

1. Phase 1  
Formulated a problem description and detailed business requirements. For this project, I decided to design a database system for the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transportation Corporation (BMTC). _Growing up in Bengaluru, BMTC has always been a part of my life, which inspired me to develop a database system for this system._

2. Phase 2  
Performed EER modeling.

3. Phase 3  
Performed Relational mapping.

4. Phase 4  
Final phase, which consisted of the following sub-phases:
- Normalized relations to BCNF.
- Transformed relations into tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
- Efficiently created scripts for DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and Drop operations, as well as ad-hoc SQL queries.

The entire journey of this project was a great learning experience that significantly strengthened my database design skills.

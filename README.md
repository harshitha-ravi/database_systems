**BMTC Connect - Metropolitan City Transportation Database System**

Utilizing Oracle RDBMS, designed and developed a database for city transportation system from the ground up. 

The entire project was divided into four phases:

Phase 1: Formulated a problem description and detailed business requirements. For this project, I decided to design a database system for the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transportation Corporation (BMTC). _Growing up in Bengaluru, BMTC has always been a part of my life, which inspired me to develop a database system for this organization._

Phase 2: Performed EER modeling.

Phase 3: Performed Relational mapping.

Phase 4: Final phase, which consisted of the following sub-phases:
4.1. Normalized relations to BCNF.
4.2. Transformed relations into tables in a relational database management system (RDBMS).
4.3. Efficiently created scripts for DDL (Data Definition Language), DML (Data Manipulation Language), and Drop operations, as well as ad-hoc SQL queries.

The entire journey of this project was a great learning experience that significantly strengthened my database design skills.
